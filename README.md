Comparison between different LF representations. Field of Parallax (FoP) distills the common features from three aspects:
Projection Difference; Adjacency Divergence; Contextual Consistency. Thanks to the unified FoP, our proposed LFX framework can
obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple LF vision tasks. “SS” stands for semantic segmentation, “SOD” refers to salient object
detection, and “OD” indicates object detection.
